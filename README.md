## 📌 Email Subject:
**Urgent: Your Email Account Will Be Deactivated in 24 Hours**

## 📧 Sender Email:
**sender@us.5ymail.me**

---

## 🚩 Red Flags Identified:

1. **Urgent Language**
   - The subject line uses fear tactics to create a sense of urgency and panic.
   - Example: _"deactivation in 24 hours"_

2. **Suspicious Sender Domain**
   - Domain `5ymail.me` is not related to any legitimate service or known organization.

3. **Generic Greeting**
   - Uses _"Dear User"_ instead of addressing the recipient by name.

4. **Phishing Link**
   - Redirects to: `fastly.net/.../xgm-enq.php` – clearly not a trusted or recognizable domain.
   - Tries to impersonate a Google service.

5. **Fake Google Login Page**
   - Design imitates Google's login page.
   - The actual domain does not match Google's legitimate domains (e.g., `accounts.google.com`).
